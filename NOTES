Elution of long cDNA:

Using MyBaits:

Protocol:
Step 1) Optional. Isolate polyA mRNA.
     Do protocol with and without this step. Instead of using qPCR to test which is
     better, just take both all the way through and make the judgement with the Minion sequencing output.

Step 2) Isolate target transcripts with biotinylated 50nt RNA baits.
     Methods:
       Miltenyi 
       https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170321253A1/en (Uses shorter probes, enabling shorter hybridization times and lower temperatures)
       MyBaits manual(?)
       In my Mendeley: Clontech "SMARTer ® Target RNA Capture for Illumina ® User Manual"
     Again, if different target isolation methods are used, make performance judgement based on Minion sequencing output.

Step 3) Create full length cDNA with Lexogen TeloPrime Kit.
       If multiplexing, use custom dT primer with a ONT bardode.
       Barcodes are in https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop/blob/master/porechop/adapters.py
       See discussion of the kit's performance in RNA workshop talk (above).

Step 4) Perform end repair / dA-tailing with NEB kit that is compatible with ONT Minion workflows

Step 5) Ligate on Minion sequencing adapters
